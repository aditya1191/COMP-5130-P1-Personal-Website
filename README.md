Typefaces in Coding

This website will be an interactive and short educational resource dedicated to the art and history of typefaces in coding. The main goal is to introduce users to the concepts of typography, showcase a curated selection of beautiful and functional coding fonts, and provide a personal narrative about how fonts can impact a developer's experience. The site's structure will be simple and intuitive, consisting of a main landing page, and how I love and adore some of the monospaced fonts. 
The design will be clean and minimal, emphasizing the fonts themselves.

The "Wow Feature" 
The "wow feature" will be an interactive Font Showcase and Playground. Unlike static 
font-preview websites, this feature will allow users to type in their own code snippet (or 
choose from pre-selected examples) and instantly see how it renders in a variety of hand-
picked coding fonts.
