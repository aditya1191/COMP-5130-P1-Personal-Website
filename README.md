Typefaces in Coding

The website, tentatively titled "Font Kissed," will be an interactive and educational 
resource dedicated to the art and history of typefaces, with a specific focus on fonts for 
coding. The main goal is to introduce users to the concepts of typography, showcase a 
curated selection of beautiful and functional coding fonts, and provide a personal narrative 
about how fonts can impact a developer's experience. The site's structure will be simple 
and intuitive, consisting of a main landing page, an "About" section that delves into the 
history of typefaces, a "Code" section highlighting specific coding fonts, and a "Blog" where 
I can share my personal journey and how I love and adore some of the monospaced fonts. 
The design will be clean and minimal, emphasizing the fonts themselves.

The "Wow Feature" (tentative idea)
The "wow feature" will be an interactive Font Showcase and Playground. Unlike static 
font-preview websites, this feature will allow users to type in their own code snippet (or 
choose from pre-selected examples) and instantly see how it renders in a variety of hand-
picked coding fonts.
